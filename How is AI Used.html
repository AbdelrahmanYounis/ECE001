                Artificial intelligence generally falls under two broad categories:
            </div>

            <ul>
                <li><i>Narrow AI:</i></li> <span>Sometimes referred to as "Weak AI," this kind of artificial intelligence operates within a limited context and is a simulation of human intelligence. Narrow AI is often focused on performing a single task extremely well and while these machines may seem intelligent, they are operating under far more constraints and limitations than even the most basic human intelligence.</span>
                <br> <br>
                <li><i>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</i></li> <span>AGI, sometimes referred to as "Strong AI," is the kind of artificial intelligence we see in the movies, like the robots from Westworld or Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation. AGI is a machine with general intelligence and, much like a human being, it can apply that intelligence to solve any problem.</span>
